		<h2>What is it?</h2>
			<br>
			<p>These are creatures that are not made from nature, but made by men. It can vary from computer bits to robots. They are used for multiple reasons, like for movies, for technics used for movies or for helping people. For example, they have made a stuffed animal ‘PARO’ which can react on people and makes movements and sounds. Elderly in nursing homes really like it, because they have something to care for and get a response. But what is the reason that we would want to have an artificial creature with emotions? This is to strive to interact with the machines and not just only operate with them. This way, you can say what you want, need or think to a machine and get the same interaction as would be with a person. A good example for this is the movie ‘her’. Here you see a men get a relationship with a computer program because she reacts like a real person.

			<h2>What did I discover?</h2>
			<br>
			<p>
				When I did some more research about Artificial intelligence (A.I), I found out that there is also a dark side about it. Because when A.I gets better, it has the possibility to get smarter than us. As <a href="https://riskworld.nl/kennis/incidenten/gevaar-van-kunstmatige-intelligentie-ai">
				this</a> Dutch article says; we get the A.I smarter, but a lot of very smart people, like Stephan Hawkin, have warned the scientists to watch out. Because it will get smarter, it will get more dangerous. Here is also a ted talk about it from Jay Tuck.

			<h2>Assignment</h2>
			<br>
			<p>
				For this assignment we had to choose out of four devices and think of a way to make this a homeostasis model. A Homeostasis model is a device that works for your needs. So it can identify a need that you (or others) have. One of the four devices was a printer and I choose this one. I choose it because always when I want to print, I have troubles with the printer (doesn’t matter if it’s mine, a friend’s or one at school). And mostly when I print, I’m in a hurry (because printing is the last thing I do before a assessment or so) and I experience some stress.
				<br>
				 So I was thinking of a printer that can identify stress and then works faster or let’s your know why exactly it doesn’t work, sometimes printers just don’t print and I have no idea why. This way you can solve the problem faster and get your printing work done. How will it work? Well, when you are stressed out your heart rate will fasten up, making you sweat and therefor making your temperature go up. This is what the sensor will do: measure the temperature around it. And I don’t mean the temperature you get of the thermostat, but the sensor measures sudden change in warmth at some point. You won’t heat up the whole room (I hope) but you will heat up a little space around you.

			<h2>Reflection</h2>
			<br>
			<p>
				I found this subject quite interesting but scary at the same time. I have seen some movies about A.I like her and ex-machina which made me doubt about the benefits from A.I. But on the other hand, when you see movies like wall-e, you will love the artificial creature and think no harm of it. I think if we keep using A.I for things like helping elderly in a nursing home or make movies more natural, it won’t be a problem. But if we really want them to feel and think like persons, it might get a problem indeed and they may outrun us.
