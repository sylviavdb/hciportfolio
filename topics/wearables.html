		<h2>What is it?</h2>
			<br>
			<p>	A Wearable is an item that you can wear on your body and is connected with a computer or mobile. It is an interface between humans (users) and computers. Some examples are activity-trackers, smartwatches or smart tattoos. These accessories work with sensors that can track, for example your heartbeat or your sleeping pattern. This way you can see what your body does in an activity or when you are a sleep. With these sensors there are a lot of options to make some things easier. An example can be with clothing. Brands like Nike and Levi’s have been making interactive shoes and jackets. The shoes of Nike are self-lacing, even when your ties have been loosing up; it will automatically tie them up. So this will make running easier, because you don’t have to worry about tying your shoes when they get looser while running. The jacket of Levi&#39;s has a way to connect with your mobile device. So you can control your music, navigation or calls with just a tap on the button on your sleeve. 
			<br>
			<br>
			On the other side of wearables, you also have ‘hideables’ like the jewelry from the brand &#39;Ringly&#39;. This is an ring that has been connected to your mobile device with an app. In this app you can decide which notification you want to know about. These notifications will make the ring vibrate.

			<h2>What did I discover?</h2>
			<br>
			<p>
				To learn more about the topic, aside from what we learned during the lectures, I’ve done some more research on the internet. There is this online-magazine called wearables which has a lot information about wearables on it. What spoke to me the most was an device that can predict and prevent asthma attacks. It is still in the testing-face, but the idea is that patients with asthma will get an patch on the chest that is connected to a wristband. The patch includes sensors that track a patient&#39;s movement, heart rate, respiratory rate, the amount of oxygen in the blood, skin impedance and wheezing in the lungs. When it shows abnormalities it will tell the patients through the wristband. I like this idea because in this way, technology is not only used for fun or to tie your shoes. It now also helps patients to make their life easier and to be less bothered by their illness. When wearables are used in health care, it will make life so much easier for the patients, doctors, nurses and so on.

			<h2>Assignment</h2>
			<br>
				<p>I had to do an assignment and I had to choose between two concepts. I choose the second concept about the smart tattoos. The whole case was: Can you think of an interactive wearable concept that has not been mentioned in the lecture, that stimulates social interaction based on smart tattoos? A smart tattoo is a tattoo that, most of the time, has a chip and makes you connected to a technological device.
			<br>
			<br>
				I was hanging out with friends the other day, after I read this assignment, and noticed how busy we all are with school, jobs, social contacts and family. Many of us also have a lot hobbies and really try to do everything. But that seems quite impossible, because we sometimes forget a lot of appointments. So, we use agenda&#39;s for this. But even those we can forget or, when we use our phone, our phone can be death. That&#39;s why I was thinking of a smart tattoo, a chip in your hand, that is connected to your agenda. One of the persons, who is included to the appointment, can set up the date and shake hands or give a high five to the others. This way the appointment will be registered in all their agenda&#39;s. For this you need Bluetooth and a mobile phone to make it work.

			See beneath for my design and maybe one day you will use this yourself!

			<h2>Reflection</h2>
			<br>
			<p>
				My point of view on this topic is positive with some negativity. I like the fact that things, like self-tying shoes or tracking a heartbeat can be made. But I find it much more interesting when this is made to actually help someone with an illness. For example: the Nike shoes. They are quite expansive and more made for fun rather to give an helping hand to someone who has an handicap and really can’t tie their own shoes. I also find it very complicated with privacy terms &#40;and I know I’m not the only one&#41;. Because when apps or devices can track so much about you, they can abuse it. 

				So what I would really value for the future is this technology will be used more in health care rather than in fashion
